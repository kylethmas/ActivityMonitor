# SH19 main

This frontend UI enables users to view alerts generated by connected devices. The interface incorporates Django secrets and API keys to ensure secure and efficient access to the required data.

Prerequistes:

* Setup a new virtual environment for the Django server, instructions for this are provided here:
  * https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_create_virtual_environment.php
* Install the required python packages, by running the following within the virtual environment:
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`


To run UI:

* In the terminal, navigate to the sh19-main\Web\censis folder `cd sh19-main\Web\censis`
* `python manage.py makemigrations myapp` this will create the database for the project
* `python manage.py migrate` this will migrate the database to the project
* `python populate_script.py` this will populate the database with some test data
* `python manage.py runserver` this will run the server on your local machine


If you're failing to send data to the UI you can probably go to the settings.py file 
And add the ip address of your local machine to the allowed hosts list.
In the terminal you can run `ipconfig` to get your ip address.

While running the django project, you can then run `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` to view the UI on any device on the same network.
